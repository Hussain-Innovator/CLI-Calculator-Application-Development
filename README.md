It starts with a shebang line #! /usr/bin/env node, 
which is a common way to make a Node.js script executable directly from the command line.
It imports the inquirer library, 
which is a popular npm package for creating command-line interfaces with interactive prompts.
It uses inquirer.prompt() to ask the user for input. 
The user is prompted to enter two numbers and select an operator
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) from a list of choices.
Based on the user's input, the script performs the corresponding arithmetic operation
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) on the two numbers and logs the result to the console.
The script includes conditional statements (if, else if, else)
to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the user's selected operator.
Overall, this script provides a basic command-line interface for performing simple arithmetic calculations interactively.
